Learn and Admire - A Tribute to Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and Cristiano Ronaldo
This project, "Learn and Admire", is a tribute to two legends: Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and Cristiano Ronaldo. Through this project, I explored the concept of React Routing and gained a deeper understanding of its impact on user navigation.

Key Features:
Ronaldo’s Section: The page re-renders to display new content, demonstrating a simple approach without React routing.

Kalam’s Section: With the use of React Routing, the navigation is smooth, and content switches seamlessly without reloading the entire page. This highlights the real power and efficiency of routing in React.

Learnings:
This project has sparked a greater curiosity in me to continue learning React and enhance my skills in building better and more efficient web experiences.
